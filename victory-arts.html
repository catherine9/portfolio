    <p class="island-1-2 text-center gutter-1-2 mega wrapper">I took a co-op opportunity to work with Tero in Victory Arts and assisted in creating videos for
    thier shows called "Me and my Monster" and YOUniverse. These primary shows I worked on are directed towards a very young demographic that includes
    lessons and facts. I was able to expand my creativity on a design level where I work on different mediums to tell a story.</p>

          <p class="island-1-2 gutter-1-2 mega wrapper">I helped out with Tero in these 5 minute animations with lessons and unique monsters that help reflect what each
          show is about. Different mediums are used to change up some of the concepts to engage with, and the monsters were styled with different colours or
          exaggerated features to make it fun for each episode. Some of these concepts were my own styles but others were done by young co-op students and I
          helped animate the episodes with the concepts the students provided to me such as the top right and the bottom right. Storyboards were encouraged to
          help breakdown how the story will go, sometimes the storyboards will be part of the video since they have a sketched out in a way that gives the feeling
          that a child helped out in the story. These were fun videos to do and there was a lot of fun to do since we had the creative freedom to stylize each
          character and scene however we want.</p>

            <p class="island-1-2 gutter-1-2 mega wrapper">The larger video projects I was working on were Space Pups and Space Car. Space car was my favourite to worke
            with. I was able to create a multimedia video using different art styles to help tell a story while appealing to the audience with colourful and cute
            characters. Each concept was reviewed by the creative director and added to the final cut. Audio and background music would be added to the video, giving
            more depth to the video. Real world facts are included to the video after the story is told and educate the kids on what we did in space or for space.</p>
