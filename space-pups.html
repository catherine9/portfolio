      <p class="island-1-2 gutter-1-2">I worked at Victory Arts during my coop weeks. One of the projects I was given the chance to do a Space Pups motion graphics for their show
      YOUniverse. The concept for this project layers with live objects and vector artwork for multimedia purposes. I created a style frame that contained vector designs and
    reference photos/textures to better utilize how I want my video to look for each scene.</p>

        <p class="island-1-2 gutter-1-2">Some of the images that were used in the video contained were everyday objects or dog toys that better represents the YOUniverse
        of our space pups. I bought colorful tennis balls, and chewy bones. I found my comfy mermaid blanket that made a really nice landscape for the first scene of the
        video. Some crystals and gemstones were used for mountains as well as a glass window or as an additional item to support the script more. An uncommon use of live objects
        was using a snowball and make it represent an asteroid passing through. Some textures I used in the video were from google such as the glitter and stock free photography of grass. </p>
