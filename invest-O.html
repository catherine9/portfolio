        <p itemprop="info">When I was working with Invest Ottawa, I worked on a series of different videos to help out with the digital marketing campaign between 2020-2021. Some
        of the projects had the same formula as they would be uploaded to social media such as Facebook, Instagram, and X(Twitter). The process for each short video were simple but
        had to be different for some. I worked alongside the social media coordinator and a graphic designer to help make these graphics come to life. Most of the projects were done
        using After Effects however, the storyboard process was usually done in Illustrator and/or photoshop.</p>
