Catherine Legault is a graphic designer set in Ottawa Canada.
Ever since I was younger I was so fascinated with  animations,
from anime and cartoons to more minimalistic animations that are used on ads for banks or online clothing stores.
The fact that animation is used in many different ways, it inspires me to design and build various types of motion elements in each project.
