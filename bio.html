        a smidge of compositing, and currently learning how to do classic animation. I enjoy watching anime, learning new languages, playing video games, all while enjoying
        a damn good latte. Haha overall I am a creative that likes to experiment with different art styles based on ispiration I see from popular motion designers such as Deekay,
        MatVoyce, Emonee LaRussa, and Michael.ny to name a few. If you want to chat, my email is just below. </p>
