        I am continuing to expand my skills in motion and strive to make even cooler animation pieces! On other days I like to unwind and watch anime, play some good ol Fallout or Minecraft, sometimes
      draw on my iPad if an inspo comes to me. Eventually I will become the ultimate Pokemon master but for motion design where I am able to know all the ins and outs in the world of motion design and
    video editing!</p>
