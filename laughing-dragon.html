    <p itemprop="info">I began as Junior Motion Designer, during which I worked on animated ads and edited videos for clients such as BHVR Interactive, PCH+, and Rewarded Play.
      After a while, I was promoted to a mid-level Motion Designer/Generalist, meaning I assisted post-production with editing videos, creating storyboards for projects, rendering animations for
      the animation team using ToonBoom Harmony I also built and edited audio and created graphical assets for projects for the motion / graphic design teams in the agency.
      I collaborated with other motion designers in larger projects such as Explainer videos. We worked to make the process run smoothly and display a professional result for the client.
      Here are some examples of my work below!.</p>

  <p itemprop="info milli">My first animated ad with the studio was this Rewarded Play video where Armanda is dressed up and bobbing for apples. I used overlord for the first time to transfer all the
    storyboard assets to After Effects. It was also my first time rigging a robotic arm for this ad. The concept of this was supposed to be simple but still excite the viewer as Armanda would reveal
    a gift card as they are bobbing the apples then reveal a phone to guide the viewer where to go afterwards.</p>

      <p itemprop="info milli">Influence Mobile needed a video for the type of activities they do and how it brings people closer together. For this video, I created the assets in the storyboard to be used in the
      video. The idea for the video was to make it all greek themed because The word "socius" is the basis for the term "sociology," which combines "socius" with the Greek word "logos" (meaning speech or reason) to describe the study of society.
    I ended up incorperating a lot of greek motifs in the video as well as animated and edited the video to make it fit in the time frame. I also edited the main audio and VO for the video using Audition.</p>

      </div>
      <p itemprop="info milli"> Our team recently got a new client; PCH+, and we were tasked of animating new stuff for their Treasure Match games. While the senior motion designer was working on the main video,
        I took the liberty to animate the logo that would be used on every treasure match ad we create. The client already delivered all the assets so I took the time to animate them in After Effects.
        I just did a simple scale in along with some glows to help make it more visually pleasing. The logo animation was used on various Treasure Match ads afterwards.</p>

      <p itemprop="info milli"> Rewarded Play asked me and another motion designer to create two different 25sec ads for them. I went for a retro 2D route and was attempting to take minor inspriation from animator Mat Voyce.
        I created the assets, storyboarded the video, as well as animate and edit the video altogether. The success of the video made its way to the
        Google Play store as the main trailer; https://play.google.com/store/apps/details/Rewarded_Play_Earn_Gift_Cards?id=com.affinity.rewarded_play&hl=en_SG&pli=1. </p>

        </div>
        <p itemprop="info milli"> For this video, PCH+ wanted this Wordmania ad to make mistakes so that the viewer can be annoyed and might want to download the game. While we had most of the assets, the Steve Harvey assets
          were limited so there were some creative liberties to make Steve Harvey "Sad". Unfortanutely, I had to do some photoshop on Steve Harveys' mouth to make him look sad. Aside from that, I did the animation,
          SFX, and main audio edit. This video was used on other platform sizes for Wordmania.</p>

        <p itemprop="info milli"> I was tasked to work on a Wordmania animated ad for PCH+ and this would the debut of the little brainy character. This was an introduction to what Wordmania has to offer.
          I was able to get some assisstance from a senior motion designer for rigging the character for the first time however, the rest of the video was animated by me along with the audio Editing,
          and title card for the beginning and end of the video.</p>

        </div>
        <p itemprop="info">Classifii was a different approach from the other videos done. I was tasked to create a 30s ad using photos and some 2D animation. The ad is to engage with the audience
          to purchase the marketplace app if you are located in Charlottetown. The animation is supposed to be very simple but still drive the message home. I created the storyboard, built the assets,
          used photos from Adobe Stock, animated the video, as well as edited the audio to fit with the overall video.</p>

        <p itemprop="info"> The client wanted to help celebrate 40 years of VOLTRON. I was tasked of editing the video to fit time time frame but not only that, I did the majority of video editing,
          audio editing, SFX add ons, as well as creating the title cards, transitions, and endcard for the whole video. It was a really fun opportunity to put my Generalist skills to use by being
          able to create this video.</p>
